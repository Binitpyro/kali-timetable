# kali-timetable

This program helps groups of students maintain their timetables. Its features include:

- Viewing who is free for the next two class slots, allowing students to coordinate and be more productive.
- Maintaining a database of the group's timetables (currently stored in a JSON file).

Additional features may be added later.
